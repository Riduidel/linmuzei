Muzei-Bash

Port of [Muzei](https://github.com/romannurik/muzei/) to Bash.

Set this script as a(n) (ana)cronjob, and it'll download a new "famous work of art" from WikiPaintings.org everyday and set it as your wallpaper.

Currently supports Linux running in a Gnome-settings-daemon-based environment (Gnome-Shell, Unity, Pantheon, etc.; sets wallpaper via gsettings).  If Gnome-settings-daemon is not running, background is set using [feh](http://feh.finalrewind.org/).  Project is still new, so we don't support blurring or dimming yet (though I don't think those are useful for desktop, unlike smartphones and tablets).

Requirements
------------

* Bash (duh!)
* jq (for parsing Muzei's JSON; can be found in Debian, Ubuntu, Arch AUR, Gentoo, and Fedora repos.  If it's not in your distro's repos, check [here](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).)
* notify-send (for sending "wallpaper changed" notifications)
* feh (only if you aren't running gnome-settings-daemon)

Installation
------------

Simply set the script as a cronjob or anacronjob with your desired running time.  If you're a noob you can use things like Gnome Schedule to do this with a GUI.

If you're an Ã¼bernoob then there's an installMuzei.sh that will do the stuff for you (copy the script to ~/bin/, set a cronjob at midnight everyday).  You'll have to have ~/bin/ in your $PATH, though (which should be the case anyway).
